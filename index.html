					<p>
						Hi! I'm Tim, co-founder and head of engineering at osil.
						I received my degree in Aerospace Engineering and
						Computer Programming at the University of Southern
						California in 2022. I am currently completing a
						full-stack course in Web Development, so I can sharpen
						my coding skills and take my company's platform to the
						next level!
						<br />
						<br />
						I worked for 2 years at a large consultancy, where I
						operated as a Site Reliability Engineer for one of the
						largest social media applications around. I left my job
						there to work full time on osil with my business
						partner, Will. We have big things coming so stay tuned!
						<br />
						<br />
						I am based in Los Angeles. In my free time I like to
						hike, lift weights, go to the beach, do yoga, and
						geocache!
